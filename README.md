## Running the Project

To run the project, follow these steps:

- Install Dependencies: Run `npm install`in the root directory to install both frontend and backend dependencies.
- Start Development Servers: Run `npm start`. This will start both the frontend development server (using Vite) and the backend server (using Node.js) concurrently.
- Access the Application: Once the servers are running, you can access the frontend application at `http://localhost:3000`.
